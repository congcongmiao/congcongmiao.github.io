<h2><strong>Research interest</strong></h2>
<div style="background-color: #e4c2f68b;">
<p>My research aims at building high-performance and reliable networking systems for various cloud applications, such as large language model and big data analytics in the hyper-scale and complex cloud. Towards this vision, my research takes a cross-layer approach to co-design different stacks of the networking system: from hardware and software disaggregation to hardware-software co-design, from optical physical layer to cloud network layer, from mathematical methodology to network system implementation.
